## Cost Analysis & Optimization

### System Operating Costs

Monthly cost breakdown for the inventory system itself:

| Component | Estimated Cost | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Lambda Execution | $2-5 | All scheduled functions, ~20K invocations |
| DynamoDB | $5-15 | On-demand pricing, includes GSIs |
| CloudWatch Logs | $2-3 | 30-day retention |
| CloudWatch Metrics | $3-5 | Custom metrics and dashboards |
| S3 Reports | $1-2 | Compressed reports with lifecycle |
| SNS Notifications | <$1 | Email and API calls |
| **Total** | **$15-30/month** | For organizations with <1000 resources |

### Built-in Optimization Features

#### 1. Automated Cost Analysis
```bash
# Daily cost analysis with trends
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name aws-inventory-collector \
  --payload '{"action": "cost_analysis"}' \
  response.json

# Results include:
# - Total monthly spend by service
# - Top 20 most expensive resources
# - Cost trends and projections
# - Savings opportunities
```

#### 2. Resource Optimization

**Idle Resource Detection**:
- EC2 instances stopped >30 days
- RDS instances with no connections
- Empty S3 buckets >90 days old
- Lambda functions with <10 invocations/month

**Right-sizing Recommendations**:
- Oversized EC2 instances (t3.2xlarge with <10% CPU)
- Over-provisioned RDS instances
- Lambda functions with excessive memory

**Example Query**:
```bash
# Find all optimization opportunities
python -m src.query.inventory_query --action cost

# Sample output:
# Idle Resources (15 found):
# - EC2: i-abc123 (stopped 45 days) - Save $50/month
# - RDS: db-prod (0 connections) - Save $200/month
# 
# Total Potential Savings: $1,250/month
```

#### 3. Department Cost Allocation

Track costs by department or cost center:
```bash
# Department breakdown
python -m src.query.inventory_query --action summary --format json | \
  jq '.cost_by_department'

# Generate department report
python -m src.query.inventory_query --action export \
  --department engineering \
  --output engineering-costs.csv
```

#### 4. Automated Actions

Configure automated responses to cost events:
```yaml
# In CloudFormation parameters:
CostThresholds:
  MonthlyLimit: 10000
  ResourceLimit: 500
  IdleResourceAction: "notify"  # or "stop"
```

### Cost Optimization Workflow

1. **Weekly Review**:
   ```bash
   # Run comprehensive cost analysis
   ./scripts/weekly-cost-review.sh
   ```

2. **Monthly Optimization**:
   ```bash
   # Identify and act on savings
   python -m src.tools.optimize_resources \
     --dry-run \
     --min-savings 50
   ```

3. **Quarterly Planning**:
   - Review Reserved Instance coverage
   - Analyze usage patterns
   - Plan capacity changes
